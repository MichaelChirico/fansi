Counterparts to R string manipulation functions that account for the effects of
ANSI text formatting control sequences.

## Formatting String with Control Sequences

Many terminals will recognize special sequences of characters in strings and
change display behavior as a result.  For example, on my terminal the sequence
`"\033&#91;42m"` turns text background green:

![hello world](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/hello.png)

The sequence itself is not shown, but the text display changes.

This type of sequence is called an ANSI CSI SGR control sequence.  Most &#42;nix
terminals support them, and newer versions of Windows and Rstudio consoles do
too.  You can check whether your display supports them by running
`term_cap_test()`.

Whether the `fansi` functions behave as expected depends on many factors,
including how your particular display handles Control Sequences.  See `?fansi`
for details, particularly if you are getting unexpected results.

## Control Sequences Require Special Handling

ANSI control characters and sequences (Control Sequences hereafter) break the
relationship between byte/character position in a string and display position.

For example, in `"Hello \033&#91;42mWorld, Good\033&#91;m Night Moon!"` the `,`
after "World" is thirteenth displayed character, but the eighteenth in
memory.  If we try to split the string after the comma with `substr` things go
wrong in several ways:

```{echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
## code for reference
hello <- "Hello \033[42mWorld, Good\033[m Night Moon!"
writeLines(substr(hello, 1, 13))
writeLines(substr(hello, 14, 29))

writeLines(substr_ctl(hello, 1, 13))
writeLines(substr_ctl(hello, 14, 29))
```
![bad substring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodieG/fansi/rc/extra/images/substr.png)

We end up cutting up our string in the middle of "World", and worse the
formatting bleeds out of our string into the prompt line.  Compare to what
happens when we use `substr_ctl`, the Control Sequence aware version of
`substr`:

## Functions

`fansi` provides counterparts to the following string functions:

* `substr`
* `strwrap`
* `strtrim`
* `nchar` / `nzchar`

These are drop-in replacements that behave (almost) identically to the base
counterparts, except for the Control Sequence awareness.  There are also
slightly improved versions of them that provide additional functionality, and
utility functions such as `strip_ctl` to remove Control Sequences and `has_ctl`
to detect whether strings contain them.

Most of `fansi` is in C so you should find performance of the `fansi` functions
to be comparable to the base functions, or in some cases like `strwrap_ctl` much
faster.

## HTML Translation

You can translate ANSI CSI SGR formatted strings into their HTML counterparts:
```{echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
N <- readLines(file.path(R.home('doc'), 'NEWS'))
N <- fansi_lines(N, step=2)                             # color each line
N <- strwrap2_ctl(N, 25, pad.end=" ", wrap.always=TRUE) # wrap to 25 chrs
N <- c("", paste(N[1:15], N[100:115], N[200:215]), "")  # make 3 cols

writeLines(N)

f <- tempfile()
writeLines(c("<html><pre>", sgr_to_html(N), "</pre></html>"), f)
browseURL(f)
```
