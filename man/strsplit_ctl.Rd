\usage{
strsplit_ctl(x, split, fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE,
  warn = getOption("fansi.warn"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{
    character vector, each element of which is to be split.  Other
    inputs, including a factor, will give an error.
  }

\item{split}{
    character vector (or object which can be coerced to such)
    containing \link{regular expression}(s) (unless \code{fixed = TRUE})
    to use for splitting.  If empty matches occur, in particular if
    \code{split} has length 0, \code{x} is split into single characters.
    If \code{split} has length greater than 1, it is re-cycled along
    \code{x}.
  }

\item{fixed}{
    logical.  If \code{TRUE} match \code{split} exactly, otherwise
    use regular expressions.  Has priority over \code{perl}.
  }

\item{perl}{logical.  Should Perl-compatible regexps be used?}

\item{useBytes}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the matching is done
    byte-by-byte rather than character-by-character, and inputs with
    marked encodings are not converted.  This is forced (with a warning)
    if any input is found which is marked as \code{"bytes"}
    (see \code{\link{Encoding}}).}

\item{warn}{TRUE (default) or FALSE, whether to warn when potentially
problematic escape sequences are encountered.  These could cause the
assumptions \code{fansi} makes about how strings are rendered on your display
to be incorrect, for example by moving the cursor (see \link{fansi}).}
}
\value{
list, see \link[base:strsplit]{base::strsplit}.

\description{
Will run \link[base:strsplit]{base::strsplit} with the provided inputs, and then will process
them to ensure the effect of CSI SGR sequences is preserved within each
element of the input character vector.
}
\details{
Currently this function will not produce the expected outcome if \code{split}
matches CSI SGR sequences.  For example, if you use \code{split='m'} this will
destroy the CSI SGR sequences as they end in the letter "m".  CSI SGR
sequences contain ESC, "[", "m", and numbers.  In future releases we will
ensure splits do not affect the CSI SGR sequences.

interpreted, particularly if you are getting unexpected results,
