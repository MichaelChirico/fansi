## Release Steps

[ ] Coverage 100%

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[ ] gcc-12
[x] R CMD check
[ ] winbuilder
[ ] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")

GA doesn't do these anymore, so we're doing it locally.

[x] R 3.2 (tests only) some issues with NA and nchar
[x] R 3.3 (tests only)

[ ] Revdep (do we let CRAN do this?)

Review the details of revdep: it claims everything is fine, but there are
several failures.  Also, it took ~10 hours to do the revdeps for 26 packages;
what is going on with that?  Possibly not enough RAM causing us to hit swap?
Need more RAM for docker?

[ ] CRAN policy

[ ] Review documentation
[ ] Update DESCRIPTION / NEWS
[ ] New README
[ ] Re-render vignette

Compiled code issues (do these last as inevitably we end up making changes).

[.] Rchk      didn't touch C-R code
[ ] valgrind
[ ] SAN
[ ] CSAN (catches things GCCSAN does not).

Optional

[ ] New animation
