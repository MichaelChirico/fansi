## Release Steps

[ ] Coverage 100%

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[x] R CMD check
[ ] CRAN version of unitizer
[ ] winbuilder    r81416
[ ] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")

[ ] R 3.2
[ ] R 3.3  Error in vignette (knitr behaves differently)?

Github Actions doesn't work anymore with the default Rstudio setup, so we've
just been running locally on our 3.3 version (or on docker?).

[ ] Revdep

Review the details of revdep: it claims everything is fine, but there are
several failures.  Also, it took ~10 hours to do the revdeps for 26 packages;
what is going on with that?  Possibly not enough RAM causing us to hit swap?
Need more RAM for docker?

[ ] Rchk
[x] valgrind
[ ] SAN
[ ] CSAN (catches things GCCSAN does not).

^ Do these last as inevitably we end up making changes

[ ] CRAN policy

[ ] Review documentation
[ ] New README
[ ] Re-render vignette

Optional

[ ] New animation
